When I click generate password, a prompt will show up asking for the amount of characters wanted for the password
I will enter a value
If the value is less than 8 or greater than 128, I will recieve an error and be asked to write in a new value











  if (capitals == false && littles == false && numbers == false && specialChar == false) {
        alert("Good");
    } else {
        alert("Password must contain one of the following: Capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters");
        writePassword();














function characterAmount{
        var charAmount = prompt("How many character would you like your password to have?");
    if (charAmount >= low && charAmount <= high) {
        console.log(charAmount);
    } else {
        alert("Please enter an amount of characters between 8 and 128.");






based on those options, generate o




    var passwordArray = [];
    if (capitals) {
        capitalOptions.push(passwordArray);
        console.log(passwordArray);
    }
